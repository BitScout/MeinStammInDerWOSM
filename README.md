MeinStammInDerWOSM
==================

Creates a SVG that visualizes the position of a DPSG group inside the WOSM

Many SVG interpreters (GIMP, LibreOffice, ...) seem to have troubles displaying the round texts, open in Chrome to see the correct result. If you find a better way to make a png from this other than by screenshot, let me know.
